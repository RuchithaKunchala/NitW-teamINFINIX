## Tic-Tac-Toe Using Minimax
*Implementation of the Minimax Algotithm to build an unbeatable TIC TAC TOE game powered by AI.*
# About the Game
*Tic-tac-toe, also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. In order to win the game, a player must place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. Players soon discover that the best play from both players leads to draw. This game is very well known as we all used to play in childhood. Some may call it " SOS " game.*
# What is Minimax ?
*Mini-max algorithm is a recursive or backtracking algorithm which is used in decision-making and game theory. It provides an optimal move for the player assuming that opponent is also playing optimally. This Algorithm computes the minimax decision for the current state. This artificial intelligence algorithm applied in two player games, such as tic-tac-toe, checkers, chess etc. This games are known as zero-sum games, because in a mathematical representation: one player wins (+1) and other player loses (-1) or both of anyone not to win (0).*
